# avatarDuelv1.0
A programming project from 8th grade (2018)

Link to project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/219114498

The project was formed by a desire to see an game with movement based bending based on the show "Avatar: The Last Airbender". The player is able to bend water by clicking on the level's water source and dragging a trail. This can be used to attack the opponent or propel the player. The game also features a simple AI that utilizes different states based on its position in the level to determine movement. 

The project has a few glitches based on what collision is possible using Scratch. I was, however, proud of it.
